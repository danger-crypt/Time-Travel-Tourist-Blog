Project for freeCodeCamp's FullStack Web Dev curriculum, in the CSS portion. Chose to make a fictional Time Travel Tourist Blog Post Card.

Currently working through the "FullStack Web Developer" curriculum on freeCodeCamp's website. The project was the "Design a Blog Post Card". I followed all the guidelines and requirements needed for completing the project, and added extra for trying to go above and beyond.
Felt I should go ahead and share this to my Github, as I hope to one day be able to work doing programming or development.

My formal education is limited to a G.E.D. Therefore, I hope to begin making my Github into a developer portfolio, where at some point, maybe my work will speak for itself and help with possible work opportunities or frankly any opportunities! I'm open to any feedback and/or advice anyone has to offer for me, so please feel free to throw in your input! Any would be greatly appreciated! Thank you for viewing.
